# Password Generator CLI

A robust command-line interface (CLI) application designed to empower users with the ability to create strong, customized passwords that meet their specific security requirements. This project prioritizes flexibility, user control, and adherence to software design principles.

## üåü Features

* **Customizable Character Sets:** Users can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their passwords.
* **User-Defined Length:** Generate passwords of any desired length, giving users full control over complexity.
* **Interactive User Experience:** Simple and intuitive prompts guide the user through the password creation process in the terminal.
* **Modular Design:** Built with a strong focus on **separation of concerns** and **SOLID principles** (e.g., Single Responsibility Principle), ensuring the codebase is clean, maintainable, and easily extensible.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x:** The core programming language, leveraging only standard libraries for simplicity and fundamental skill development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install & Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    If you haven't already, clone the project to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Password-Generator-CLI.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Password-Generator-CLI.git)
    cd Password-Generator-CLI
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername` and `Password-Generator-CLI` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)*

2.  **Run the application:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py # Or whatever your main script file is named (e.g., app.py)
    ```

## üí° How to Use

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen prompts:

1.  You will be asked to specify the desired length for your password.
2.  Next, you'll be prompted to choose which types of characters to include (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
3.  The application will then generate and display your custom password in the terminal.

## üìò Learning Focus: Software Design Principles

This project serves as a hands-on exercise to practice and solidify understanding of key software design principles, including:

* **Separation of Concerns:** Each part of the application (user input, character selection, password generation) is handled by distinct functions or modules.
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Functions are designed to do one thing and do it well, making the code easier to understand, test, and modify.
* *(You can expand on other SOLID principles here as you implement them!)*

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements

* **Copy to Clipboard:** Implement functionality to automatically copy the generated password to the user's clipboard for convenience.
* More advanced password strength indicators.
* Option to exclude similar-looking characters (e.g., 'l', '1', 'I', 'O', '0').
